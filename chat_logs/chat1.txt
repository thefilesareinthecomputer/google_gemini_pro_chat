The Zachman Framework is an enterprise ontology and is a fundamental structure for enterprise architecture which provides a formal and structured way of viewing and defining an enterprise. The ontology is a two dimensional classification schema that reflects the intersection between two historical classifications. The first are primitive interrogatives: What, How, When, Who, Where, and Why. The second is derived from the philosophical concept of reification, the transformation of an abstract idea into an instantiation. The Zachman Framework reification transformations are: identification, definition, representation, specification, configuration and instantiation.The Zachman Framework is not a methodology in that it does not imply any specific method or process for collecting, managing, or using the information that it describes; rather, it is an ontology whereby a schema for organizing architectural artifacts (in other words, design documents, specifications, and models) is used to take into account both who the artifact targets (for example, business owner and builder) and what particular issue (for example, data and functionality) is being addressed.The framework is named after its creator John Zachman, who first developed the concept in the 1980s at IBM. It has been updated several times since.


== Overview ==
The title "Zachman Framework" refers to The Zachman Framework for Enterprise Architecture with version 3.0 being the most current. The Zachman Framework has evolved in its thirty-year history to include:

The initial framework, named A Framework for Information Systems Architecture, by John Zachman published in a 1987 article in the IBM Systems journal.
The Zachman Framework for Enterprise Architecture, an update of the 1987 original in the 1990s extended and renamed .
One of the later versions of the Zachman Framework, offered by Zachman International as industry standard.In other sources the Zachman Framework is introduced as a framework, originated by and named after John Zachman, represented in numerous ways, see image. This framework is explained as, for example:  

a framework to organize and analyze data,
a framework for enterprise architecture.
a classification system, or classification scheme
a matrix, often in a 6x6 matrix format
a two-dimensional model or an analytic model.
a two-dimensional schema, used to organize the detailed representations of the enterprise.Beside the frameworks developed by John Zachman, numerous extensions and/or applications have been developed, which are also sometimes called Zachman Frameworks, however they generally tend to be graphical overlays of the actual framework itself.
The Zachman Framework summarizes a collection of perspectives involved in enterprise architecture. These perspectives are represented in a two-dimensional matrix that defines along the rows the type of stakeholders and with the columns the aspects of the architecture. The framework does not define a methodology for an architecture. Rather, the matrix is a template that must be filled in by the goals/rules, processes, material, roles, locations, and events specifically required by the organization. Further modeling by mapping between columns in the framework identifies gaps in the documented state of the organization.The framework is a logical structure for classifying and organizing the descriptive representations of an enterprise. It is significant to both the management of the enterprise, and the actors involved in the development of enterprise systems. While there is no order of priority for the columns of the Framework, the top-down order of the rows is significant to the alignment of business concepts and the actual physical enterprise. The level of detail in the Framework is a function of each cell (and not the rows). When done by IT the lower level of focus is on information technology, however it can apply equally to physical material (ball valves, piping, transformers, fuse boxes for example) and the associated physical processes, roles, locations etc. related to those items.


== History ==
In the 1980s John Zachman had been involved at IBM in the development of business system planning (BSP), a method for analyzing, defining and designing an information architecture of organizations. In 1982 Zachman had already concluded that these analyses could reach far beyond automating systems design and managing data into the realms of strategic business planning and management science in general. It may be employed in the (in that time considered more esoteric) areas of enterprise architecture, data-driven systems design, data classification criteria, and more.


=== "Information Systems Architecture" framework ===
In the 1987 article "A Framework for Information Systems Architecture" Zachman noted that the term "architecture" was used loosely by information systems professionals, and meant different things to planners, designers, programmers, communication specialists, and others. In searching for an objective, independent basis upon which to develop a framework for information systems architecture, Zachman looked at the field of classical architecture, and a variety of complex engineering projects in industry. He saw a similar approach and concluded that architectures exist on many levels and involves at least three perspectives: raw material or data, function of processes, and location or networks.The Information Systems Architecture is designed to be a classification schema for organizing architecture models. It provides a synoptic view of the models needed for enterprise architecture. Information Systems Architecture does not define in detail what the models should contain, it does not enforce the modeling language used for each model, and it does not propose a method for creating these models.


=== Extension and formalization ===
In the 1992 article "Extending and Formalizing the Framework for Information Systems Architecture" John F. Sowa and John Zachman present the framework and its recent extensions and show how it can be formalized in the notation of conceptual graphs. Also in 1992:

John Zachman's co-author John Sowa proposed the additions of the Scope perspective of the ‘planner’ (bounding lists common to the enterprise and its environment) and the Detailed Representation perspective of the ‘sub-contractor’ (being the out-of-context vendor solution components). The Who, When and Why columns were brought into public view, the notion of the four levels of metaframeworks and a depiction of integration associations across the perspectives were all outlined in the paper. Keri Anderson Healey assisted by creating a model of the models (the framework metamodel) which was also included in the article.
Later during the 1990s
Methodologists like Clive Finkelstein refocused on the top two framework rows which he labeled Enterprise Engineering and has one of the most successful methods for converging the business needs with information technology engineering implementation, and determining a logical build sequence of the pieces.


=== Framework for enterprise architecture ===
In the 1997 paper "Concepts of the Framework for Enterprise Architecture" Zachman said that the framework should be referred to as a "Framework for Enterprise Architecture", and should have from the beginning. In the early 1980s however, according to Zachman, there was "little interest in the idea of Enterprise Reengineering or Enterprise Modeling and the use of formalisms and models was generally limited to some aspects of application development within the Information Systems community".In 2008 Zachman Enterprise introduced the Zachman Framework: The Official Concise Definition as a new Zachman Framework standard.


=== Extended and modified frameworks ===
Since the 1990s several extended frameworks have been proposed, such as:

Matthew & McGee (1990) extended the three initial perspectives "what", "how" and "where", to event (the "when"), reason (the "why") and organization (the "who").
Evernden (1996) presented an alternative Information FrameWork.
The Integrated Architecture Framework developed by Capgemini since 1996.
Vladan Jovanovic et al. (2006) presents a Zachman Cube, an extended of the Zachman Framework into a multidimensional Zachman's Cube.


== Zachman Framework topics ==


=== Concept ===
The basic idea behind the Zachman Framework is that the same complex thing or item can be described for different purposes in different ways using different types of descriptions (e.g., textual, graphical). The Zachman Framework provides the thirty-six necessary categories for completely describing anything; especially complex things like manufactured goods (e.g., appliances), constructed structures (e.g., buildings), and enterprises (e.g., the organization and all of its goals, people, and technologies). The framework provides six different transformations of an abstract idea (not increasing in detail, but transforming) from six different perspectives.It allows different people to look at the same thing from different perspectives. This creates a holistic view of the environment, an important capability illustrated in the figure.


=== Views of rows ===
Each row represents a total view of the solution from a particular perspective. An upper row or perspective does not necessarily have a more comprehensive understanding of the whole than a lower perspective. Each row represents a distinct, unique perspective; however, the deliverables from each perspective must provide sufficient detail to define the solution at the level of perspective and must translate to the next lower row explicitly.Each perspective must take into account the requirements of the other perspectives and the restraint those perspectives impose. The constraints of each perspective are additive. For example, the constraints of higher rows affect the rows below. The constraints of lower rows can, but do not necessarily affect the higher rows. Understanding the requirements and constraints necessitates communication of knowledge and understanding from perspective to perspective. The Framework points the vertical direction for that communication between perspectives.
The current version (3) of the Zachman Framework categorizes the rows as follows:

Executive Perspective (Scope Contents) - The first architectural sketch is a "bubble chart" or Venn diagram, which depicts in gross terms the size, shape, partial relationships, and basic purpose of the final structure. It corresponds to an executive summary for a planner or investor who wants an overview or estimate of the scope of the system, what it would cost, and how it would relate to the general environment in which it will operate.
Business Management Perspective (Business Concepts) - Next are the architect's drawings that depict the final building from the perspective of the owner, who will have to live with it in the daily routines of business. They correspond to the enterprise (business) models, which constitute the designs of the business and show the business entities and processes and how they relate.
Architect Perspective (System Logic) - The architect's plans are the translation of the drawings into detail requirements representations from the designer's perspective. They correspond to the system model designed by a systems analyst who must determine the data elements, logical process flows, and functions that represent business entities and processes.
Engineer Perspective (Technology Physics) - The contractor must redraw the architect's plans to represent the builder's perspective, with sufficient detail to understand the constraints of tools, technology, and materials. The builder's plans correspond to the technology models, which must adapt the information systems model to the details of the programming languages, input/output (I/O) devices, or other required supporting technology.
Technician Perspective (Tool Components) - Subcontractors work from shop plans that specify the details of parts or subsections. These correspond to the detailed specifications that are given to programmers who code individual modules without being concerned with the overall context or structure of the system. Alternatively, they could represent the detailed requirements for various commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), government off-the-shelf (GOTS), or components of modular systems software being procured and implemented rather than built.
Enterprise Perspective or (Operations Instances)


=== Focus of columns ===
In summary, each perspective focuses attention on the same fundamental questions, then answers those questions from that viewpoint, creating different descriptive representations (i.e., models), which translate from higher to lower perspectives. The basic model for the focus (or product abstraction) remains constant. The basic model of each column is uniquely defined, yet related across and down the matrix. In addition, the six categories of enterprise architecture components, and the underlying interrogatives that they answer, form the columns of the Zachman Framework and these are:
Inventory Sets — What
Process Flows — How
Distribution Networks — Where
Responsibility Assignments — Who
Timing Cycles — When
Motivation Intentions — WhyIn Zachman's opinion, the single factor that makes his framework unique is that each element on either axis of the matrix is explicitly distinguishable from all the other elements on that axis. The representations in each cell of the matrix are not merely successive levels of increasing detail, but actually are different representations — different in context, meaning, motivation, and use. Because each of the elements on either axis is explicitly different from the others, it is possible to define precisely what belongs in each cell.


=== Models of cells ===
The Zachman Framework typically is depicted as a bounded 6 x 6 "matrix" with the Communication Interrogatives as Columns and the Reification Transformations as Rows.  The framework classifications are repressed by the Cells, that is, the intersection between the Interrogatives and the Transformations.The cell descriptions are taken directly from version 3.0 of the Zachman Framework.

Sure, here is a more detailed and thorough explanation of the Zachman Framework:

The Zachman Framework is a two-dimensional classification schema that provides a structured way of viewing and defining an enterprise. It was developed by John Zachman in the 1980s to help businesses organize and manage their information systems architecture.

The framework consists of six rows and six columns, which represent different perspectives and aspects of an enterprise. The rows represent the different levels of abstraction, from the highest level (Executive Perspective) to the lowest level (Enterprise Perspective). The columns represent the different types of information that can be captured about an enterprise, from the most general (Inventory Sets) to the most specific (Motivation Intentions).

The cells of the framework represent the intersection of a row and a column, and they provide a specific type of information about the enterprise. For example, the cell in the Executive Perspective row and the Inventory Sets column would contain information about the overall scope of the enterprise, such as its mission, vision, and goals.

The Zachman Framework is a powerful tool that can be used to improve the communication and coordination between different stakeholders in an enterprise. It can also help to ensure that all of the necessary information about an enterprise is captured and documented.

Here are some additional details about each of the rows and columns of the Zachman Framework:

**Rows:**

* **Executive Perspective:** This row represents the highest level of abstraction and provides a broad overview of the enterprise. It includes information about the enterprise's mission, vision, goals, and objectives.
* **Business Management Perspective:** This row represents the perspective of the business managers who are responsible for running the enterprise. It includes information about the enterprise's business processes, organizational structure, and financial information.
* **Architect Perspective:** This row represents the perspective of the architects who are responsible for designing the enterprise's systems and infrastructure. It includes information about the enterprise's system architecture, data architecture, and technology architecture.
* **Engineer Perspective:** This row represents the perspective of the engineers who are responsible for building and maintaining the enterprise's systems and infrastructure. It includes information about the enterprise's hardware, software, and networks.
* **Technician Perspective:** This row represents the perspective of the technicians who are responsible for operating and maintaining the enterprise's systems and infrastructure. It includes information about the enterprise's procedures, policies, and standards.
* **Enterprise Perspective:** This row represents the lowest level of abstraction and provides a detailed view of the enterprise. It includes information about the enterprise's assets, resources, and activities.

**Columns:**

* **Inventory Sets:** This column represents the most general type of information that can be captured about an enterprise. It includes information about the enterprise's assets, resources, and activities.
* **Process Flows:** This column represents information about the processes that are performed within the enterprise. It includes information about the sequence of steps in each process, the inputs and outputs of each process, and the resources that are used in each process.
* **Distribution Networks:** This column represents information about the distribution of the enterprise's assets, resources, and activities across different locations. It includes information about the physical location of each asset, resource, or activity, as well as the relationships between different locations.
* **Responsibility Assignments:** This column represents information about the responsibilities that are assigned to different individuals or groups within the enterprise. It includes information about the roles and responsibilities of each individual or group, as well as the relationships between different roles and responsibilities.
* **Timing Cycles:** This column represents information about the timing of the enterprise's activities. It includes information about the start and end times of each activity, as well as the duration of each activity.
* **Motivation Intentions:** This column represents information about the reasons why the enterprise exists and why it performs its activities. It includes information about the enterprise's mission, vision, goals, and objectives.

The Zachman Framework is a complex and comprehensive tool, but it can be a valuable resource for businesses that are looking to improve their communication, coordination, and documentation.

I hope this explanation is more detailed and thorough. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
